			<p>
				<i>direct object</i> is a book. it is a collection of the ways we all individually react to a central idea. it is a frame for these reactionary objects – your objects – to cohabitate. it lives in print and online. 
			</p>
			<p class="section_title">how we work</p>
			<p>
				we will provide the central idea, the catalyst for each issue. think of your submissions as objects – artifacts of your reaction to the idea. they should be literal, absolute, exact. the only lens is your perspective. a hand is a hand is a hand.
			</p>
			<p>
				each submission should fit within the frame of a single page. we accept any media, but please limit submissions to “one” – one photo, one hundred words of text, one piece of mail, one minute of video, one fingernail clipping.
			</p>
			<p>
				in the same way a window provides clarity but also a reflection, the lenses will be compiled to present a composite view of a singular idea.
