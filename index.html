			<p>
				<i>direct object</i> is a book. It is a collection of the ways we all individually react to a central idea. It is a frame for these reactionary objects – your objects – to cohabitate. It lives in print and online. 
			</p>
			<p class="section_title">how we work</p>
			<p>
				We will provide the central idea, the catalyst for each issue. Think of your submissions as objects – artifacts of your reaction to the idea. They should be literal, absolute, exact. The only lens is your perspective. A hand is a hand is a hand.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each submission should fit within the frame of a single page. We accept any media, but please limit submissions to “one” – one photo, one hundred words of text, one piece of mail, one minute of video, one fingernail clipping.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the same way a window provides clarity but also a reflection, the lenses will be compiled to present a composite view of a singular idea.
